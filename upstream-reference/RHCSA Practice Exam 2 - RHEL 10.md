# 🧪 RHCSA Practice Exam #2 — RHEL 10 (EX200)

> **Format:** Performance-based | **Time budget:** 3 hours | **Pass Score:** ~70% (25 / 35)
> All configurations **must persist after reboot** without intervention.
> You may use `man`, `info`, and `/usr/share/doc` — no internet access on exam day.
> This exam re-tests the same objectives as Exam #1 using different scenarios, values, and services.

> **⏱️ Budget is 3 hours, not 2.5.** 35 tasks at 2.5 hrs works out to ~4.3 min/task, which is not achievable. Don't read a timer overrun as "not ready" — the real EX200 presents far fewer, larger tasks. Confirm the real exam's current duration on Red Hat's objectives page.

> **📌 Answer key is at the end of this file, not under each task.** Solutions and the command quick-reference were moved on 2026-09-09 so this exam can be re-run cold.

## 🖥️ Lab Environment Setup

### Required Virtual Machines

| VM                 | vCPU | RAM  | Primary Disk      | Extra Disks                                            |
| ------------------ | ---- | ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `rhel10-charlie` | 2    | 2 GB | 20 GB`/dev/vda` | 8 GB`/dev/vdb`, 6 GB `/dev/vdc`, 4 GB `/dev/vdd` |
| `rhel10-delta`   | 2    | 2 GB | 20 GB`/dev/vda` | 8 GB`/dev/vdb`                                       |

### VM Configuration Notes

- Install **RHEL 10** minimal install on both VMs
- Suggested IPs (different subnet than Exam #1 to avoid stale ARP/host key issues):
  - `rhel10-charlie`: `10.20.30.11/24`
  - `rhel10-delta`: `10.20.30.12/24`
- **Break-in target is `charlie` this time** — forget the root password on `charlie` before starting
- Boot `delta` into `rescue.target` initially so Task 2 forces you to change it
- Do **not** pre-configure repos, SSH keys, or firewall rules — those are exam tasks
- Add the extra disks **after** the OS install, unpartitioned

### Repo Setup (Pre-Task — Simulates Exam Environment)

- Register with `subscription-manager` **or** mount the RHEL 10 ISO
- Do not create the repo files yet — that's Task 13
- If offline, keep the ISO attached at `/dev/sr0`

---

## 📋 Exam Instructions

1. All tasks must be completed on the correct host (`charlie` or `delta`)
2. All configurations must survive a `reboot` — test this for critical tasks
3. Work methodically; a wrong `fstab` entry can break boot
4. Do NOT delete pre-existing users, groups, files, or services unless explicitly told to
5. If a task depends on a previous one and you cannot complete the previous, **still attempt the current one** on a plausible substitute
6. **Do not scroll to the answer key.** If you're stuck, use `man` — that's the skill being tested

## 🚀 PRACTICE EXAM #2 — 35 TASKS

---

### SECTION 1: System Recovery & Boot Management

---

**Task 1 — Emergency Recovery via GRUB Kernel Argument** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Interrupt the boot process in order to gain access to a system

The root password on `rhel10-charlie` is unknown. This time, use the **`init=/bin/bash`** method (not `rd.break`) to recover:

1. Interrupt GRUB, edit the kernel line, replace `ro` with `rw` and append `init=/bin/bash`
2. Boot to a raw bash shell
3. Reset the root password to `Ex200Pass!`
4. Ensure SELinux will relabel on next boot
5. Reboot cleanly

---

**Task 2 — Change Default Target from Rescue to Graphical** *(delta)*

> Objective: Boot systems into different targets manually

`rhel10-delta` is booting into `rescue.target`. Change the default target to `graphical.target` and reboot. Verify with `systemctl get-default` and confirm `runlevel` output shows `5`.

Then install the required package group if the GUI is not present.

---

**Task 3 — Bootloader: Disable Quiet Boot and Add Kernel Argument** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Modify the system bootloader

On `charlie`, edit GRUB with the following persistent changes:

- Remove `rhgb` and `quiet` from `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX`
- Add `audit=1` and `net.ifnames=0`
- Set `GRUB_TIMEOUT=5`

Regenerate GRUB using `grub2-mkconfig` **and** rebuild the initramfs with `dracut -f`. Reboot and verify with `cat /proc/cmdline`.

---

### SECTION 4: SSH & Remote Access

---

**Task 11 — SSH Key Auth + Disable Password Auth for a Specific User** *(charlie ↔ delta)*

> Objective: Configure key-based authentication for SSH

1. As `root` on `charlie`, generate an **ecdsa-sha2-nistp521** key (no passphrase)
2. Copy the key to `root@delta` using `ssh-copy-id`
3. Create `emma` on `delta` (same UID) and set up key auth from `emma@charlie` → `emma@delta` using an **ed25519** key with passphrase `Lab#2026`
4. On `delta`, configure `sshd_config` so:
   - `PermitRootLogin` = `prohibit-password`
   - `PasswordAuthentication no` **for user `emma` only** (use a `Match User emma` block)
   - `AllowUsers root emma frank`
5. Reload `sshd` and validate with `sshd -t`

---

**Task 12 — Secure File Transfer with Bandwidth Limit + Checksums** *(charlie ↔ delta)*

  - Preserve permissions, ownership, timestamps
  - Limit bandwidth to `500 KB/s`
  - Delete extraneous files on destination
- Use `sftp` in **batch mode** with a batch file `/root/sftp_batch.txt` that uploads `/etc/hostname` from charlie to `/tmp/` on delta
- Generate a SHA-256 checksum of `/etc/hostname` on both sides and confirm they match

---

### SECTION 5: Software Management

---

**Task 13 — Configure Two Repositories + GPG Key Import** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Configure access to RPM repositories, install/remove RPM software packages

1. Mount RHEL 10 ISO at `/mnt/rhel10`
2. Create `/etc/yum.repos.d/lab-baseos.repo` and `/etc/yum.repos.d/lab-appstream.repo` (**two separate files** this time)
3. Both must have `gpgcheck=1` — import the GPG key from `/mnt/rhel10/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release`
4. Set `enabled=1` and `metadata_expire=1h`
5. Priority: BaseOS = `10`, AppStream = `20` (`dnf-plugin-priorities` if needed)
6. Confirm with `dnf repolist enabled` and by listing packages available from `lab-baseos` only

---

**Task 14 — Flatpak: Configure Remote + Install App** *(charlie, requires GUI or CLI-only ok)*

> Objective: Configure access to Flatpak repositories, Install and remove Flatpak software packages

3. Search for the app `gedit` (or `org.gnome.gedit`)
4. Install it system-wide
5. List installed Flatpak apps
6. Uninstall it and remove unused runtimes

*(If no internet: document steps in `/root/flatpak_procedure.txt` and skip installation.)*

---

**Task 15 — RPM Verification + Reinstall** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Install and update software packages (RPM level)

1. Install `nano` and record its version
2. Verify the installed package reports no modifications — output should be clean

4. Restore the config file to its packaged state
5. Query which package owns `/etc/hosts`
6. Query all files installed by the `chrony` package
7. List all installed packages sorted by install date

---

### SECTION 6: Storage — Partitions, LVM & Swap

---

**Task 16 — GPT Partitions with `parted` (Scripted)** *(charlie, `/dev/vdb`)*

> Objective: List, create, and delete partitions on GPT disks

Using **`parted` in non-interactive mode** (not `fdisk`/`gdisk`) on `/dev/vdb`:

1. Create GPT label
2. Create partitions:

   - `vdb1`: 2 GiB — for XFS
   - `vdb2`: 1 GiB — for swap
   - `vdb3`: rest of disk — for LVM (flag: `lvm`)
3. Verify alignment with `parted /dev/vdb align-check optimal 1`
4. Run `partprobe /dev/vdb`

---

**Task 17 — VFAT Filesystem + Mount by Label** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Create, mount, unmount, and use VFAT, ext4, and XFS file systems

- Format `vdb1` as **XFS** with label `charlieXFS`
- Create a small VFAT filesystem on `/dev/vdc` (use partition `vdc1`, size 500 MiB) with label `USBDATA`
- Mount points: `/mnt/charliexfs` and `/mnt/usbdata`
- `/etc/fstab`:
  - `vdb1` mounted by **UUID**
  - `vdc1` mounted by **LABEL**, mount options `noexec,nodev,nosuid`
- Run `mount -a`, then `systemctl daemon-reload`
- Reboot and confirm both are mounted

---

**Task 18 — Swap File (Not Partition) with Priority** *(delta)*

> Objective: Add new partitions and logical volumes, and swap to a system non-destructively

This exam variant uses a **swap file** instead of a swap partition:

1. Create a `1 GiB` file at `/swap/extraswap.img` (use `dd` or `fallocate`)
2. Set permissions to `0600`
3. Format it with `mkswap`
4. Add to `/etc/fstab` with priority `20`, activate with `swapon -a`
5. Verify with `swapon --show` and `free -h`

---

**Task 19 — LVM with Striping and Custom PE Size** *(charlie, `/dev/vdb3` + `/dev/vdd`)*

> Objective: Create/remove PVs, VGs, LVs

1. Initialize `/dev/vdb3` and `/dev/vdd` as physical volumes (whole `vdd`, no partition)
2. Create VG `vg_lab2` with PE size **32 MiB**
3. Create a **striped** LV `lv_stripe` with 2 stripes across both PVs, size `1 GiB`
4. Create a **linear** LV `lv_home2` sized using **80 extents**
5. Format `lv_stripe` as **ext4** and `lv_home2` as **XFS**
6. Mount both persistently at `/mnt/stripe` and `/mnt/home2`
7. Verify with `pvs`, `vgs`, `lvs -a -o+devices`

---

**Task 20 — Reduce a VG, Then Extend an LV** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Extend existing logical volumes; move data non-destructively

1. Migrate all extents off `/dev/vdd`. A plain `pvmove` **will fail here** — work out why, and find the flag that makes it succeed
2. Remove `/dev/vdd` from `vg_lab2` (`vgreduce`)
3. Wipe the LVM signature from `/dev/vdd` (`pvremove`, `wipefs -a`)
4. Extend `lv_home2` to **use all remaining free space** in `vg_lab2` in a **single command** and grow the XFS filesystem online
5. Confirm with `df -h /mnt/home2` and `lvs -a -o+devices` — note what happened to `lv_stripe`'s segment type

---

### SECTION 7: File Systems & NFS

---

**Task 21 — NFSv4 Only, With Kerberos-Ready sec Option** *(delta)*

> Objective: Mount and unmount network file systems using NFS

On `delta` (NFS server):

1. Install `nfs-utils`
2. Disable NFSv3 via `/etc/nfs.conf` — v3 off, v4 and v4.2 on
3. Create `/srv/nfs/projects` and `/srv/nfs/archive`
4. Export them:
   - `/srv/nfs/projects` — read/write to `10.20.30.0/24`, `sync`, `sec=sys`, `no_subtree_check`
   - `/srv/nfs/archive` — read-only to `charlie.ex200.lab`, `sync`, `sec=sys`, `root_squash`
5. Firewall: allow `nfs` service permanently
6. Start/enable `nfs-server`; validate with `exportfs -v` and `showmount -e localhost`

---

**Task 22 — NFS Client with `nofail` and Async Options** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Mount and unmount network file systems using NFS

On `charlie`:

1. Mount points: `/mnt/projects` and `/mnt/archive`
2. Add persistent `/etc/fstab` entries mounting both exports as `nfs4`, with `_netdev` and `nofail`; projects read/write, archive read-only
3. Run `systemctl daemon-reload && mount -a`
4. Create a file in `/mnt/projects` as `root` — expect success
5. Try in `/mnt/archive` — expect read-only failure

---

**Task 23 — AutoFS Indirect Map With Wildcard & Custom Timeout** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Configure autofs

Configure autofs to mount user home directories from `delta:/srv/nfs/homes/<user>` under `/net/homes/<user>`:

1. Install `autofs`
2. Create a master map entry for `/net/homes` with a `60`-second timeout and `--ghost` enabled
3. Create the indirect map file using a wildcard key so any username resolves to its export
4. On `delta`: create `/srv/nfs/homes/emma`, add to exports, reload
5. On `charlie`: `su - emma`, then `ls /net/homes/emma` should trigger the mount
6. Wait 60 seconds idle — mount should auto-unmount

---

**Task 24 — Permission Repair Scenario** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Diagnose and correct file permission problems

The application at `/opt/finance/` has been broken by a bad `chmod`. Fix these issues:

1. `/opt/finance/` — currently `000`; should be `2750`, owned by `gina:ops`
2. `/opt/finance/reports/` — should inherit group `ops` via SGID
3. `/opt/finance/bin/run_report.sh` — needs `0754` and setuid `gina` (mode `4754`)
4. `/opt/finance/private/` — must be `0700`, owned by `gina:gina`
5. Find every SUID binary under `/usr/bin` and save to `/root/suid_list.txt`

---

### SECTION 8: System Services, Logging & Time

---

**Task 25 — Chrony Server + Client** *(both nodes)*

> Objective: Configure time service clients

- On `delta`: configure `chrony` as an **NTP server** for the `10.20.30.0/24` subnet. Enable and start `chronyd`, open firewall for `ntp`.
- On `charlie`: configure `chrony` client to use **delta only** as its time source; remove pool/server defaults.
- Verify with `chronyc sources -v` on charlie — delta should appear with `^*` or `^+`.
- Set timezone: `charlie` → `Europe/London`, `delta` → `Asia/Tokyo`.

---

**Task 26 — Tuned: Create a Fully Custom Profile** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Manage tuning profiles

1. Install and enable `tuned`
2. Create a **new** profile `lab-highio` in `/etc/tuned/lab-highio/tuned.conf`:
   - Inherit from `throughput-performance`
   - Set `vm.dirty_ratio = 40`
   - Set `vm.swappiness = 10`
   - Set CPU governor to `performance`
3. Activate it
4. Confirm with `tuned-adm active` and `sysctl vm.swappiness`
5. Verify persistence after reboot

---

**Task 27 — Nice, Cgroup Limits, and Killing by Pattern** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Identify CPU/memory intensive processes and kill processes; Adjust process scheduling

1. Launch a CPU-heavy task (`openssl speed -multi 2 &`, or `stress-ng --cpu 2 &`)
2. Launch a task that genuinely consumes RAM — writing into `/dev/shm` (tmpfs) works without extra packages. Watch it with `free -h`, and clean up afterward: the file stays resident in RAM even after the writer exits
3. Identify the top CPU consumer using `ps` with a sort field
4. Change one process's nice value from its default to `19`
5. Launch a process bounded to 20% of a CPU using a transient systemd scope
6. Kill all `stress-ng` and `openssl` processes by matching the full command line
7. Send `SIGHUP` to `chronyd` and confirm via journal that it re-read its config

---

**Task 28 — Journal Forwarding + Log Rotation** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Locate and interpret system log files and journals; Preserve system journals

1. Enable persistent journal storage, max disk size `500M`
2. Configure `journald` to **forward to syslog**
3. Configure `rsyslog` to write `authpriv.*` to `/var/log/secure.lab`, and rotate it weekly keeping 8 weeks via `/etc/logrotate.d/secure.lab`
4. Test: attempt a failed `sudo` as `frank` → confirm the entry appears in both the journal (matched by command name) and `/var/log/secure.lab`
5. Prune journal entries older than 7 days

---

**Task 29 — Systemd Timer with OnCalendar Every 3 Hours** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Schedule tasks using at, cron and systemd timer units

1. `at`: schedule for 3 minutes from now: append `"at-fired $(date)"` to `/var/log/at_lab.log`
2. `cron`: as `emma`, run `df -h > ~/disk_report.log` every **weekday at 07:15**
3. `systemd timer`:
   - Service `/etc/systemd/system/labhealth.service` runs `/usr/local/bin/labhealth.sh`
   - Script writes `uptime`, `free -m`, and `df -h /` to `/var/log/labhealth.log`
   - Timer `/etc/systemd/system/labhealth.timer` fires **every 3 hours**, `Persistent=true`
   - Enable timer, verify with `systemctl list-timers --all`

---

### SECTION 9: Shell Scripting

---

**Task 30 — Argument Parser with `case` Statement** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Conditionally execute code; Process script inputs

Write `/usr/local/bin/svcctl.sh` that:

- Takes **two** arguments: `<action>` and `<service>`
- Valid actions: `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `status`, `check`
- `check` should print `RUNNING` or `STOPPED` based on `systemctl is-active`
- Any other action → print usage to `stderr` and exit `2`
- If service does not exist (`systemctl cat` fails), print `"Unknown service"` and exit `3`
- Return proper exit codes; test with `bash -x`

Use a `case` statement, not chained `if/elif`.

---

**Task 31 — While-Read Loop That Processes a CSV** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Use looping constructs; Processing output of shell commands within a script

Write `/usr/local/bin/csv_users.sh`:

- Input file `/root/newusers.csv` with format `username,uid,gid,fullname`:

  ivan,2200,6000,Ivan Petrov
  julia,2201,6000,Julia Kim
  kai,2202,6001,Kai Nguyen
- For each line:

  - Skip lines starting with `#` or blank lines
  - Create the user with the given UID, GID (assume group exists), and full name as comment
  - Set a random password generated with `openssl`
  - Append `username,password` to `/root/passwords.txt` (mode `0600`)
- Use `while IFS=, read -r ...` and `[[ ... ]]` tests

---

**Task 32 — Reporting Script with Trap and Cleanup** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Process output of shell commands within a script

Write `/root/health_report.sh`:

- Collects: hostname, kernel, uptime, load, top 5 CPU processes, disk usage, failed systemd units
- Writes to `/tmp/health.$$.tmp` first, then atomically moves to `/var/log/health/$(hostname)-$(date +%F).log`
- Uses `trap` to clean up the tmp file on error/interrupt
- Rotates: keep only 14 daily reports
- Schedule via **cron** at `06:00` every day **except the 1st of the month**

---

### SECTION 10: SELinux

---

**Task 33 — SELinux for a Custom Web Root** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Set enforcing/permissive modes; list/identify SELinux file & process context; restore contexts

1. Confirm SELinux is `enforcing`; if not, set it permanently
2. Install `httpd`, enable, start
3. Create `/srv/websites/site1/`; add `index.html` = `"Site1 charlie"`
4. Configure `httpd` to use `/srv/websites/site1/` as `DocumentRoot` (drop-in `/etc/httpd/conf.d/site1.conf`)
5. On restart, `httpd` fails or serves 403 — diagnose it from the journal and the audit log
6. Apply the correct persistent file context for `/srv/websites` and everything below it
7. Verify with `curl http://localhost/` → returns `"Site1 charlie"`
8. Confirm the process context of `httpd`

---

**Task 34 — Non-Standard SSH Port with SELinux + Booleans** *(charlie)*

> Objective: Manage SELinux port labels; use Boolean settings

1. Configure `sshd` to listen on **port 2222** in addition to 22
2. Add `2222/tcp` to the SELinux policy so sshd may bind it
3. Add firewall rule for port `2222/tcp` in `labzone` (persistent)
4. Restart `sshd`, confirm it is listening on both ports
5. Enable persistently the boolean `ssh_sysadm_login` (or `use_nfs_home_dirs` if not present) and verify
6. Set the boolean `container_manage_cgroup` on persistently
7. Copy `/etc/motd` to `/var/www/html/motd.txt`; observe its context is `admin_home_t` or `etc_t`; fix it so it becomes `httpd_sys_content_t`

### SECTION 11: Containers with Podman

---

**Task 35 — Rootless Container with Persistent Volume + Quadlet Timer** *(charlie, as user `emma`)*

> Objective: Find/retrieve/inspect images; run containers; configure as systemd service; attach persistent storage

As user `emma` (rootless):

1. Enable **linger** for `emma`
2. Log in as `emma`, ensure `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is set
3. Search and pull `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi10/nginx-124` (**nginx**, not httpd this time)
4. Inspect the image; note the exposed port and the user it runs as
5. Create a named **podman volume** `emma-nginx-data` and place an `index.html` in it containing `Emma Nginx OK`
6. Create Quadlet **volume** and **container** files under `~/.config/containers/systemd/`:
   - A `.volume` unit declaring the named volume
   - A `.container` unit running the nginx image as `emma_nginx`, publishing host port `9090` to container port `8080`, mounting the volume at the nginx web root with the correct SELinux relabel flag, restarting always, and allowing a generous start timeout
7. Reload the user daemon and start the service
8. Test: `curl http://localhost:9090/` from `emma`
9. **Bonus** — create a **Quadlet timer** that restarts the container every night at 03:00
10. Reboot; verify container starts automatically without emma logging in

## ✅ Quick Verification Script

Run on the relevant host **after a reboot**. Checks the objectively-verifiable, persistence-sensitive items only — a safety net against marking something "done" that didn't actually persist, not a full grader. Tasks needing human judgement (T11 SSH keys, T12 transfers, T30–32 script behaviour) aren't covered.

```bash

# 🔑 ANSWER KEY

> **Stop.** Do not read this during a timed run. Score yourself from the checklist first, then come back here for the tasks you missed.

---

### Section 1 — Boot & Recovery

**T1 — Break-in via init=/bin/bash**

```bash
# At GRUB: 'e', on the linux line change ro -> rw, append init=/bin/bash, Ctrl-X
mount -o remount,rw /       # if needed
passwd root                 # Ex200Pass!
touch /.autorelabel
exec /sbin/init             # or: sync; reboot -f
```

Different from `rd.break` — you skip systemd entirely, so the root filesystem is already mounted by the kernel.

**T2 — Rescue → graphical**

```bash
systemctl set-default graphical.target
dnf group install "Server with GUI"
systemctl get-default
runlevel        # shows 5
```

**T3 — Bootloader**

```bash
vim /etc/default/grub    # remove rhgb quiet; add audit=1 net.ifnames=0; GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
dracut -f
reboot
cat /proc/cmdline
```

> `net.ifnames=0` reverts to legacy `ethX` naming — do this **before** Task 4/5, since the interface name changes.

---

### Section 5 — Software Management

**T13 — Two repo files + GPG**

```bash
dnf --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="lab-baseos" list available | head
```

**T14 — Flatpak remote**

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

**T15 — RPM verify / reinstall**

```bash
rpm -V nano                 # clean = no output
# after editing /etc/nanorc:
rpm -V nano                 # S.5....T.  c /etc/nanorc
dnf reinstall nano
rpm -qf /etc/hosts
rpm -ql chrony
rpm -qa --last | head
```

---

### Section 6 — Storage

**T16 — parted scripted**

```bash
parted -s /dev/vdb mklabel gpt
parted -s /dev/vdb mkpart primary xfs 1MiB 2049MiB
parted -s /dev/vdb mkpart primary linux-swap 2049MiB 3073MiB
parted -s /dev/vdb mkpart primary 3073MiB 100%
parted -s /dev/vdb set 3 lvm on
```

**T20 — pvmove, vgreduce, extend**

`lv_stripe` is striped 2-way across `vdb3` and `vdd`, so a plain `pvmove` has nowhere to put its extents once `vdd` is gone — LVM needs as many target PVs as stripes unless you force it. `--alloc anywhere` collapses it onto the single remaining PV, and `lv_stripe`'s segment type becomes linear.

```bash
pvmove --alloc anywhere /dev/vdd
vgreduce vg_lab2 /dev/vdd
pvremove /dev/vdd
lvextend -l +100%FREE -r /dev/vg_lab2/lv_home2
```

---

### Section 7 — NFS & AutoFS

**T21 — NFSv4-only exports**

`/etc/nfs.conf`: under `[nfsd]` set `vers3=n`, `vers4=y`, `vers4.2=y`.

```text
/srv/nfs/projects  10.20.30.0/24(rw,sync,sec=sys,no_subtree_check)
/srv/nfs/archive   charlie.ex200.lab(ro,sync,sec=sys,root_squash)
```

**T22 — NFS client fstab**

```text
delta:/srv/nfs/projects  /mnt/projects  nfs4  _netdev,nofail,rw  0 0
delta:/srv/nfs/archive   /mnt/archive   nfs4  _netdev,nofail,ro  0 0
```

**T23 — AutoFS wildcard indirect map**

`/etc/auto.master.d/labhome.autofs`:

```text
/net/homes  /etc/auto.labhome  --timeout=60 --ghost
```

`/etc/auto.labhome`:

```text
*  -fstype=nfs4,rw,soft  delta.ex200.lab:/srv/nfs/homes/&
```

**T24 — SUID inventory**

```bash
find /usr/bin -perm -4000 -type f > /root/suid_list.txt
```

> Heads up: the Linux kernel ignores the setuid bit on shebang scripts, so step 3's `4754` on `run_report.sh` sets the bit correctly but will not actually elevate privilege at exec time.

---

### Section 8 — Services, Logging & Time

**T25 — Chrony server**

On delta, add `allow 10.20.30.0/24` to `/etc/chrony.conf`. On charlie, comment out the pool/server defaults and add `server delta.ex200.lab iburst`.

**T27 — Process management**

```bash
openssl speed -multi 2 &
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/shm/memtest bs=1M count=800 &
# or: stress-ng --vm 1 --vm-bytes 800M --timeout 60s &
free -h
rm -f /dev/shm/memtest      # tmpfs file stays resident after dd exits

ps -eo pid,pri,ni,pcpu,comm --sort=-pcpu | head
renice -n 19 -p <pid>
systemd-run --scope -p CPUQuota=20% stress-ng --cpu 1 --timeout 30s
pkill -f stress-ng
pkill -f openssl
sudo kill -HUP $(pgrep chronyd)
journalctl -u chronyd -n 20
```

**T28 — Journal forwarding + logrotate**

`/etc/systemd/journald.conf`: `Storage=persistent`, `SystemMaxUse=500M`, `ForwardToSyslog=yes`.

rsyslog rule: `authpriv.*    /var/log/secure.lab`

`/etc/logrotate.d/secure.lab`:

```text
/var/log/secure.lab {
    weekly
    rotate 8
    missingok
    notifempty
    compress
    delaycompress
}
```

```bash
journalctl _COMM=sudo
journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
```

**T29 — Timer every 3 hours**

`OnCalendar=*-*-* 00/3:00:00` with `Persistent=true`. Weekday cron for emma: `15 7 * * 1-5 df -h > ~/disk_report.log`.

---

### Section 9 — Scripting

**T31 — Random password**

`openssl rand -base64 12` yields a 16-character base64 string.

**T32 — Cron "every day except the 1st"**

Cron has no "except" operator — use a day-of-month range: `0 6 2-31 * * /root/health_report.sh`

---

### Section 10 — SELinux

**T33 — Custom web root**

```bash
journalctl -u httpd
ausearch -m avc -ts recent
semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t '/srv/websites(/.*)?'
restorecon -Rv /srv/websites
curl http://localhost/
ps -eZ | grep httpd
```

**T34 — Non-standard SSH port**

```bash
semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 2222
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=labzone --add-port=2222/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
ss -tlnp | grep -E ':22|:2222'
getsebool ssh_sysadm_login
setsebool -P container_manage_cgroup on
restorecon -v /var/www/html/motd.txt
```

---

### Section 11 — Containers

**T35 — Quadlet volume + container**

`~/.config/containers/systemd/emma-nginx.volume`:

```ini
[Volume]
VolumeName=emma-nginx-data
```

`~/.config/containers/systemd/emma-nginx.container`:

```ini
[Unit]
