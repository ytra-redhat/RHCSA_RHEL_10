# 🧪 RHCSA Practice Exam — RHEL 10 (EX200)

> **Format:** Performance-based | **Time budget:** 3 hours | **Pass Score:** ~70% (25 / 35)
>
> All configurations **must persist after reboot** without intervention.
>
> You may use `man`, `info`, and `/usr/share/doc` — no internet access on exam day.

> **⏱️ Budget is 3 hours, not 2.5.** 35 tasks at 2.5 hrs works out to ~4.3 min/task, which is not achievable. Don't read a timer overrun as "not ready" — the real EX200 presents far fewer, larger tasks, so per-task pacing here doesn't transfer. Confirm the real exam's current duration on Red Hat's objectives page.

> **📌 Answer key is at the end of this file, not under each task.** This exam originally carried its solutions inline; they were moved on 2026-09-09 so it can be re-run cold. Working it with the answers visible trains recognition — the real exam tests recall.

## 🖥️ Lab Environment Setup

### Required Virtual Machines

| VM               | vCPU | RAM  | Primary Disk      | Extra Disks                              |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `rhel10-alpha` | 2    | 2 GB | 20 GB`/dev/vda` | none (add 10 GB`/dev/vdb` after setup) |
| `rhel10-bravo` | 2    | 2 GB | 20 GB`/dev/vda` | 10 GB`/dev/vdb`, 5 GB `/dev/vdc`     |

### VM Configuration Notes

- Install **RHEL 10** minimal install on both VMs
- Set up a **NAT/Host-Only network** so both VMs can communicate
- Suggested IPs:
  - `rhel10-alpha`: `192.168.100.10/24`
  - `rhel10-bravo`: `192.168.100.20/24`
- **Do NOT** configure SSH root login or repo access — those are exam tasks
- Set root password on alpha to something you remember; **forget it on bravo** (Task 1 requires breaking in)
- Add the 10 GB disk to `rhel10-alpha` **unpartitioned** after OS install for storage tasks

### Repo Setup (Pre-Task — Simulates Exam Environment)

The real exam has repos pre-configured or gives you a URL. For lab purposes, either:

- Subscribe with a Red Hat Developer account: `subscription-manager register`
- Or mount the RHEL 10 ISO and configure a local repo (covered in Task 13)

---

## 📋 Exam Instructions

Read carefully before beginning:

1. All tasks must be completed on the correct host (alpha or bravo)
2. All configurations must survive a `reboot` — test this for critical tasks
3. Partial credit is not given on the real exam — complete each task fully
4. Work methodically; a wrong fstab entry can break boot
5. **Do not scroll to the answer key.** If you're stuck, use `man` — that's the skill being tested

## 🚀 PRACTICE EXAM — 35 TASKS

---

### SECTION 1: System Recovery & Boot Management

---

**Task 1 — Break Into bravo and Reset Root Password** *(bravo)*

> Objective: Interrupt the boot process in order to gain access to a system

The root password on `rhel10-bravo` is unknown. Break into the system using the `init=/bin/bash` method, reset the root password to `RedHat10!`, and ensure SELinux labels are updated before the next boot. Reboot and confirm login.

   - Map local port `8080` to container port `8080`
   - Bind-mount `~/web_content/` to `/var/www/html/` with `:Z` for SELinux
5. Verify the container is running with `podman ps`
6. Test with `curl http://localhost:8080`
7. Create a **Podman Quadlet** at `~/.config/containers/systemd/alice-web.container` that reproduces that container as a user systemd service, starting at login. It must set the image, container name, published port, and the bind-mounted volume with the correct SELinux relabel flag, and restart always.
8. Enable user lingering for `alice`
9. Reload the user daemon and start the service
10. Reboot and confirm the container starts automatically and the webpage is accessible

## ✅ Quick Verification Script

Run on the relevant host **after a reboot**. Checks the objectively-verifiable, persistence-sensitive items only — it is a safety net against marking something "done" that didn't actually persist, not a full grader. Tasks needing human judgement (T11 SSH keys, T12 transfers, T30–32 script behaviour) aren't covered.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ex1-verify.sh — spot-check Exam 1 persistence. Run with sudo on each host.
pass=0; fail=0
chk() { # chk "label" "command"
  if eval "$2" &>/dev/null; then printf '  \033[32mPASS\033[0m  %s\n' "$1"; pass=$((pass+1))
  else printf '  \033[31mFAIL\033[0m  %s\n' "$1"; fail=$((fail+1)); fi

# 🔑 ANSWER KEY

> **Stop.** Do not read this during a timed run. Score yourself from the checklist first, then come back here for the tasks you missed.

---

### Section 1 — System Recovery & Boot Management

**T1 — Break into bravo**

> Note from an earlier run: rd.break drops to an emergency mode, not a shell — `init=/bin/bash` is the method used here. *(Worth re-verifying on RHEL 10; standard Red Hat courseware still documents `rd.break` as valid.)*

Key steps: `init=/bin/bash`, `mount -o remount,rw /`, `passwd root`, `touch /.autorelabel`, `exec /sbin/reboot -f`

**T2 — Boot target**

```
systemctl get-default
systemctl set-default multi-user.target
```

**T3 — Bootloader**

```
sudo vim /etc/default/grub
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg   # BIOS
# OR
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg  # UEFI
```

---

### Section 2 — Networking & Hostname

**T4 — Static IP and hostname**

```bash
nmcli con show # get interface name
sudo nmcli con add type ethernet ifname "interface-name" con-name "connection-name"
nmcli con mod "connection-name" ipv4.addresses 192.168.100.10/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.100.1 ipv4.method manual
nmcli con mod "connection-name" ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1"
nmcli con mod "connection-name" ipv6.addresses fd00::10/64 ipv6.method manual
nmcli con up "connection-name"
hostnamectl set-hostname alpha.lab.local
```

**T5 — Firewall**

```bash
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-port=5900-5910/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
firewall-cmd --list-all
firewall-cmd --zone=internal --list-all
```

---

### Section 3 — Users, Groups & Permissions

**T7 — Password aging**

```bash
for user in alice bob carol dave; do echo "${user}:Lab@12345"; done | sudo chpasswd
sudo chage alice -m 7 -M 60 -W 10
sudo passwd bob -n 5 -x 90 -w 14 -i 10
sudo chage carol -d 0
```

Then set `PASS_MIN_LEN 8` in `/etc/login.defs`.

**T9 — Set-GID collaborative directory**

```bash
mkdir -p /data/devshare
chown alice:developers /data/devshare
chmod 3770 /data/devshare
```

Mode `3770` = SGID (2000) + sticky (1000) + `rwxrwx---`.

**T10 — Umask**

```bash
# In /etc/profile.d/umask.sh
umask 0007
```

`umask 007` → files `666-007 = 660`, directories `777-007 = 770`.

---

### Section 5 — Software Management

**T13 — Repositories**

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sr0 /mnt/rhel10iso

# Create the repo 
sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/rhel10-local.repo >/dev/null <<'EOF'
[BaseOS]
name=Base OS Packages from DVD
baseurl=file:///mnt/rhel10iso/BaseOS
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

[AppStream]
name=AppStream Packages from DVD
baseurl=file:///mnt/rhel10iso/AppStream
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF

# Verify
sudo dnf repolist
ls /mnt/rhel10iso/

# Make persist past reboot
echo '/dev/sr0  /mnt/rhel10iso  iso9660  ro,nofail  0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# Test persistence without reboot
sudo umount /mnt/rhel10iso 2>/dev/null
sudo mount -a
sudo dnf repolist
ls /mnt/rhel10iso/
```

**T14 — Package management**

```bash
sudo dnf install vim-enhanced tmux wget httpd -y
rpm -qc httpd
sudo dnf download --destdir /root/downloads/ nmap
# using * with sudo expands as the user not root and returns nothing.  
# Use sudo bash -c to start a root shell to run the command to see the proper expansion or type the whole filename
sudo bash -c 'rpm -K /root/downloads/nmap-*.rpm' 
sudo bash -c 'rpm -ivh /root/downloads/nmap-*.rpm'
sudo rpm -e nmap

# Verify Uninstall, use before uninstall to verify present
sudo rpm -qa nmap
```

**T15 — Package groups, Flatpak, versioned RPMs**

```bash
# Part A
sudo dnf group list
sudo dnf group info "Development Tools"
sudo dnf group install "Development Tools" -y
sudo dnf group remove "Development Tools" -y

# Part B
flatpak remotes
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak search gimp
flatpak install flathub org.gimp.GIMP -y
flatpak list
flatpak run org.gimp.GIMP
flatpak update -y
flatpak uninstall org.gimp.GIMP -y
flatpak uninstall --unused -y

# Part C
dnf list postgresql\*        # discover available versioned packages
sudo dnf install postgresql-server -y
rpm -q postgresql-server
```

> ⚠️ Legacy note (know it exists, don't rely on it): `dnf module list/enable/install/reset` still runs in RHEL 10 but prints "modularity is deprecated" and will be removed in the next major release. postgresql is no longer delivered as a module on RHEL 10, so `dnf module list postgresql` returns nothing — install the RPM directly.

### Section 6 — Storage

**T16 — GPT partitions**

```bash
# Open fdisk
sudo fdisk /dev/vdb

# Inside fdisk:
g          # Create GPT partition table

n          # Create vdb1
<Enter>    # Partition number 1
<Enter>    # First sector
+1G        # Size

n          # Create vdb2
<Enter>    # Partition number 2
<Enter>    # First sector
+500M      # Size

t          # Change partition type
2          # Select partition 2
19         # Linux swap

n          # Create vdb3
<Enter>    # Partition number 3
<Enter>    # First sector
+2G        # Size

p          # Verify partition layout

w          # Write changes and exit
```

```bash
# Inform the kernel of partition table changes
sudo partprobe /dev/vdb

# Verify
lsblk
sudo fdisk -l /dev/vdb
```

Expected Result:

```text
/dev/vdb1    1G    Linux filesystem
/dev/vdb2  500M    Linux swap
/dev/vdb3    2G    Linux filesystem
```

**T17 — Filesystems by UUID and LABEL**

```bash
# Create filesystems
sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/vdb1
sudo mkfs.ext4 -L DATASTORE /dev/vdb3

# Create mount points
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/xfs_data
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/ext4_data

# Get UUID of vdb1
UUID=$(sudo blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/vdb1)

# Add persistent mounts to /etc/fstab
echo "UUID=${UUID} /mnt/xfs_data xfs defaults 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
echo "LABEL=DATASTORE /mnt/ext4_data ext4 defaults 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# Mount all filesystems
sudo mount -a

# Verify
df -hT
lsblk -f

# Create test files
sudo touch /mnt/xfs_data/xfs_test.txt
sudo touch /mnt/ext4_data/ext4_test.txt

# Reboot and verify persistence
sudo reboot
```

After reboot:

```bash
df -hT
ls /mnt/xfs_data
ls /mnt/ext4_data
```

Expected Result:

```text
/dev/vdb1 mounted on /mnt/xfs_data (xfs) using UUID=
/dev/vdb3 mounted on /mnt/ext4_data (ext4) using LABEL=DATASTORE

/mnt/xfs_data/xfs_test.txt exists
/mnt/ext4_data/ext4_test.txt exists
```

**T18 — Swap with priority**

```bash
# Create swap signature
sudo mkswap /dev/vdb2

# Get UUID
UUID=$(sudo blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/vdb2)

# Add persistent swap entry with priority 10
echo "UUID=${UUID} none swap defaults,pri=10 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# Verify fstab
tail -1 /etc/fstab

# Enable swap
sudo swapon -a

# Verify
swapon --show
free -h

# Reboot and verify persistence
sudo reboot
```

After reboot:

```bash
swapon --show
free -h
```

Expected Result:

```text
NAME      TYPE SIZE USED PRIO
/dev/vdb2 partition 500M   0B   10
```

And:

```text
Swap: 500M
```

**T19 — LVM**

```bash
# Create physical volume
sudo pvcreate /dev/vdc

# Create volume group with 16 MiB PE size
sudo vgcreate -s 16M vg_lab /dev/vdc

# Create logical volumes
sudo lvcreate -L 500M -n lv_data vg_lab
sudo lvcreate -l 25 -n lv_logs vg_lab

# Format logical volumes
sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/vg_lab/lv_data
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_lab/lv_logs

# Create mount points
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/lv_data
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/lv_logs

# Get UUIDs
UUID_DATA=$(sudo blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/vg_lab/lv_data)
UUID_LOGS=$(sudo blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/vg_lab/lv_logs)

# Add persistent mounts
echo "UUID=${UUID_DATA} /mnt/lv_data xfs defaults 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
echo "UUID=${UUID_LOGS} /mnt/lv_logs ext4 defaults 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# Verify fstab
tail -2 /etc/fstab

# Mount and verify
sudo mount -a
df -hT

# Verify LVM layout
sudo pvs
sudo vgs
sudo lvs
```

Expected Result:

```text
PV: /dev/vdc     VG: vg_lab
VG PE size: 16.00 MiB
lv_data  500.00m  (XFS)   -> /mnt/lv_data
lv_logs  400.00m  (ext4)  -> /mnt/lv_logs     # 25 extents x 16 MiB
```

**T20 — Extend an LV**

```bash
# Verify free space in the volume group
sudo vgs vg_lab

# Extend LV to 1 GiB and grow filesystem in one command
sudo lvextend -L 1G -r /dev/vg_lab/lv_data

# Confirm new size
df -h /mnt/lv_data
sudo lvs
```

Expected Result:

```text
lv_data  vg_lab  1.00g   -> /mnt/lv_data (XFS)

df -h shows /mnt/lv_data ~1.0G
```

### Section 7 — File Systems & NFS

**T21 — NFS server**

```bash
# Install NFS utilities
sudo dnf install -y nfs-utils

# Create export directories
sudo mkdir -p /export/shared
sudo mkdir -p /export/readonly
```

**3 ways to make the /export/shared directory writable on the server (bravo):**

```bash
# Loosen permissions (not recommended for production)
sudo chmod 0777 /export/shared

# Own the dir by the squashed user on the server
sudo chown nobody:nobody /export/shared

# Set Specific user/group ownership and use root_squash in /etc/exports (recommended)
# NFS Service User Setup — Map All Clients to `nfsuser` (UID/GID 1500)

# Create the group with a specific GID
sudo groupadd -g 1500 nfsuser

# Create the user with a specific UID, primary group, no login
sudo useradd -u 1500 -g 1500 -M -s /sbin/nologin nfsuser

# Verify the IDs
id nfsuser

# Own the export directory by that service user
sudo chown -R nfsuser:nfsuser /export/shared

# Set collaborative permissions (SGID so new files inherit the group)
sudo chmod 2775 /export/shared

# Configure the export to squash everyone to UID/GID 1500
echo "/export/shared 192.168.100.0/24(rw,sync,all_squash,anonuid=1500,anongid=1500)" | sudo tee -a /etc/exports

# Add export for read-only directory
echo "/export/readonly 192.168.100.10(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)" | sudo tee -a /etc/exports

# Verify exports file
cat /etc/exports

# Enable and start the NFS server
sudo systemctl enable --now nfs-server.service

# Add permanent firewall rules
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mountd
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=rpc-bind
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Re-export and confirm
sudo exportfs -rav
sudo exportfs -v
```

Expected Result:

```text
/export/shared    192.168.100.0/24(rw,sync,...)
/export/readonly  192.168.100.10(ro,sync,...)
```

**T22 — NFS client**

```bash
# Install NFS utilities (needed for the client too)
sudo dnf install -y nfs-utils

# Create mount points
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs_shared
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs_ro

# Add persistent NFS entries to /etc/fstab
echo "192.168.100.20:/export/shared /mnt/nfs_shared nfs _netdev 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
echo "192.168.100.20:/export/readonly /mnt/nfs_ro nfs _netdev 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# Verify fstab
tail -2 /etc/fstab

# Mount and verify
sudo mount -a
df -hT

# Create test file on the shared (rw) mount
sudo touch /mnt/nfs_shared/from_alpha.txt
ls -l /mnt/nfs_shared
```

On bravo, confirm the file appeared:

```bash
ls -l /export/shared
```

Expected Result:

```text
192.168.100.20:/export/shared   -> /mnt/nfs_shared  (nfs4)
192.168.100.20:/export/readonly -> /mnt/nfs_ro       (nfs4)

/export/shared/from_alpha.txt   visible on bravo
```

**T23 — AutoFS**

Prerequisite — export /export/home on bravo:

```bash
# On bravo
sudo mkdir -p /export/home
sudo useradd -b /export/home autouser        # test user with home under /export/home
echo "/export/home 192.168.100.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,crossmnt,no_root_squash)" | sudo tee -a /etc/exports
sudo exportfs -rav
sudo exportfs -v
```

**On alpha**

```bash
# Install autofs
sudo dnf install -y autofs

# DIRECT MAP — master entry
echo "/-  /etc/auto.direct" | sudo tee /etc/auto.master.d/direct.autofs

#  Direct map file
echo "/autodir  -rw  bravo:/export/shared" | sudo tee /etc/auto.direct

# INDIRECT MAP — master entry
echo "/mnt/autohome  /etc/auto.home" | sudo tee /etc/auto.master.d/home.autofs

# Indirect map file (& expands to the requested key/username)
echo "*  -rw  bravo:/export/home/&" | sudo tee /etc/auto.home

# Enable and start autofs
sudo systemctl enable --now autofs

# Verify service and maps
sudo systemctl status autofs
```

**Test**

```bash
# Direct map — access triggers the mount
ls /autodir
df -hT | grep autodir

# Indirect map — accessing a user's path triggers the mount
ls /mnt/autohome/autouser
df -hT | grep autohome
```

**Expected Result:**

```text
bravo:/export/shared          -> /autodir           (auto-mounted on access)
bravo:/export/home/autouser   -> /mnt/autohome/autouser (auto-mounted on access)
```

**T24 — Permission diagnostics**

```bash
# Fix /var/www/html — root:root, world-readable, not world-writable
sudo chown root:root /var/www/html
sudo chmod 755 /var/www/html

# Verify
ls -ld /var/www/html

# Create /secure/app — alice:developers, no access for others, SGID
sudo mkdir -p /secure/app
sudo chown alice:developers /secure/app
sudo chmod 2770 /secure/app

# Verify
ls -ld /secure/app


# Fix /tmp/badperms — 640, bob:developers
sudo touch /tmp/badperms
sudo chown bob:developers /tmp/badperms
sudo chmod 640 /tmp/badperms

# Verify
ls -l /tmp/badperms

# Find world-writable files under /etc and save the list
sudo find /etc -perm -o+w -type f > /root/world_writable.txt

# Verify
sudo cat /root/world_writable.txt
```

**Expected Results:**

```text
/var/www/html   drwxr-xr-x  root root
/secure/app     drwxrws---  alice developers
/tmp/badperms   -rw-r-----  bob developers
/root/world_writable.txt   contains any world-writable files found under /etc
```

### Section 8 — System Services, Logging & Time

**T25 — Chrony**

```bash
# Install chrony if not present
sudo dnf install -y chrony

# Add the primary NTP source to /etc/chrony.conf
# (comment out existing pool/server lines first for a clean config)
sudo sed -i 's/^pool /#pool /; s/^server /#server /' /etc/chrony.conf
echo "pool 2.rhel.pool.ntp.org iburst" | sudo tee -a /etc/chrony.conf

# Verify the line was added
grep "2.rhel.pool.ntp.org" /etc/chrony.conf

# Enable and start chronyd
sudo systemctl enable --now chronyd

# Restart to apply config changes, then verify
sudo systemctl restart chronyd
chronyc tracking
chronyc sources -v
timedatectl

# Timezone — alpha
sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/Chicago
timedatectl

# Timezone — bravo
sudo timedatectl set-timezone UTC
timedatectl
```

**T26 — Tuned**

```bash
# Install, enable, and start tuned
sudo dnf install -y tuned
sudo systemctl enable --now tuned

# List all available profiles
tuned-adm list

# Show the currently active profile
tuned-adm active

# Change active profile to throughput-performance
sudo tuned-adm profile throughput-performance

# Verify the active profile
tuned-adm active

# Create the merged custom profile 'lab-custom'
sudo mkdir -p /etc/tuned/lab-custom
sudo tee /etc/tuned/lab-custom/tuned.conf <<'EOF'
[main]
summary=Custom merged profile: virtual-guest + powersave
include=virtual-guest,powersave
EOF

# Apply lab-custom and verify
sudo tuned-adm profile lab-custom

# In RHEL 10 power-profiles-daemon (ppd) is layered on top of
# tuned and will override the profile after reboot if not set directly
echo "lab-custom" | sudo tee /etc/tuned/ppd_base_profile
sudo systemctl restart tuned
tuned-adm active

# Ensure persistence before reboot
systemctl is-enabled tuned           # 1. enabled
cat /etc/tuned/active_profile        # 2. your profile name
cat /etc/tuned/profile_mode          # 3. manual
cat /etc/tuned/ppd_base_profile      # 4. your profile name  ← RHEL 10 addition


# Reboot and verify
sudo reboot -h now

# Verify
tuned-adm active       # confirm lab-custom is current
sudo tuned-adm verify  # check applied settings match the profile (may warn on VMs)
tuned-adm list | grep lab-custom   # confirm it appears in the profile list
```

**Expected Results:**

```text
tuned-adm active  ->  Current active profile: lab-custom
```

**T27 — Process management**

```bash
# Launch three background dd processes
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null &
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null &
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null &

# Identify them
ps -C dd -o pid,ni,pcpu,comm
# or watch live:
top -c            # press 'q' to quit
# or:
pidstat 1 3       # 1-sec samples, 3 times

# Grab one PID to work with
PID=$(pgrep -n dd)     # newest dd process
echo "$PID"

# Set niceness to 10 (raising nice = lower priority, allowed as user)
renice -n 10 -p "$PID"

# Set niceness to -5 (lowering nice = higher priority, requires root)
sudo renice -n -5 -p "$PID"

# Verify the nice change
ps -o pid,ni,comm -p "$PID"

# Kill all dd processes
killall dd

# Confirm none remain
pgrep -x dd || echo "no dd processes running"
ps -C dd

# Signal lifecycle on a sleep process
sleep 3600 &
SPID=$!
echo "sleep PID: $SPID"

kill -SIGSTOP "$SPID"     # pause (state T)
ps -o pid,stat,comm -p "$SPID"

kill -SIGCONT "$SPID"     # resume (state S)
ps -o pid,stat,comm -p "$SPID"

kill -SIGTERM "$SPID"     # terminate
pgrep -x sleep || echo "sleep terminated"

# Launch a niced process
nice -n 15 sleep 1000 &
ps -o pid,stat,ni,comm -p $!
```

Expected Results:

```text
Step 3:  NI = 10   (as regular user)
Step 4:  NI = -5   (root required)
Step 5:  all dd processes gone
Step 6:  STAT T (stopped) -> S (sleeping) -> process ends
Step 7:  new sleep with NI = 15
```

**T28 — Persistent journal and rsyslog**

```bash
# Configure journald for persistent storage
sudo sed -i 's/^#\?Storage=.*/Storage=persistent/' /etc/systemd/journald.conf

# Create the persistent journal directory (journald will also do this itself on restart)
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/journal
sudo systemd-tmpfiles --create --prefix /var/log/journal

# Restart journald to apply
sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald

# Verify the directory exists and journald is using it
ls -ld /var/log/journal
journalctl --disk-usage

# Logs since last boot
journalctl -b

# Filter logs for the sshd service
journalctl -u sshd

# Only error-level and above
journalctl -p err

# Last 50 lines
journalctl -n 50

# Configure rsyslog to write all *.info messages to /var/log/messages.info
echo "*.info    /var/log/messages.info" | sudo tee -a /etc/rsyslog.conf

# Restart rsyslog to apply
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog

# Send a test message and verify it landed in the right log
logger "RHCSA test message from $(hostname)"
grep "RHCSA test message" /var/log/messages.info
```

Expected Results:

```text
Step 1-2:  /etc/systemd/journald.conf has Storage=persistent; /var/log/journal/ exists after restart
Step 3:    journalctl -b, -u sshd, -p err, -n 50 all return filtered output
Step 4:    /var/log/messages.info receives *.info and higher messages after rsyslog restart
Step 5:    logger test line appears in /var/log/messages.info
```

**T29 — at, cron, systemd timer**

```bash
# 1. at — one-time job in 5 minutes
# Ensure atd is running
sudo systemctl enable --now atd

# Schedule the job
echo 'echo "Scheduled at task ran" >> /var/log/at_test.log' | at now + 5 minutes

# Verify it's queued
atq
at -l              # same thing

# 2. cron — daily job for user alice at 8:00 AM
# Edit alice's crontab (as alice, or use -u as root)
sudo crontab -e -u alice

# Add this line:
0 8 * * * date >> ~/cron_test.log

# Verify:
sudo crontab -l -u alice

# 3. systemd timer — hourly script
# Create the script
sudo tee /usr/local/bin/hourly_check.sh <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "$(date)" >> /var/log/hourly.log
EOF
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hourly_check.sh

# Create the service unit
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/hourly-check.service <<'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Hourly check script

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/hourly_check.sh
EOF

# Create the timer unit

[Unit]
Description=Run hourly-check every hour

[Timer]
OnCalendar=hourly
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
EOF

# Reload systemd, enable and start the TIMER (not the service)
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now hourly-check.timer

# Verify
systemctl status hourly-check.timer
systemctl list-timers hourly-check.timer
```

Expected Results:

```text
at:      atq shows one queued job
cron:    crontab -l -u alice shows the 8:00 AM line
timer:   list-timers shows hourly-check.timer with a NEXT run time
```

echo "Exit code: $?"     # should be 1 for bad/no arg
```

**T31 — bulk_users.sh**

```bash
# Create the username list
sudo tee /root/userlist.txt <<'EOF'
testuser1

**T32 — etcbackup.sh**

```bash
# Create the backup script
sudo tee /root/etcbackup.sh <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

BACKUP_DIR="/root/backups"
DATE=$(date +%F)
ARCHIVE="etc_backup_${DATE}.tar.gz"

# Verify:

sudo crontab -l
```

In cron's day-of-week field, `0` (and `7`) is Sunday, so `1-6` is Monday through Saturday.
